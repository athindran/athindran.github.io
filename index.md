Hi. I am Athindran. I am currently a machine learning engineer in Behavior Planning at Aurora Innovation in Pittsburgh, PA. I was a sixth-year PhD student in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Princeton University. I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. Peter Ramadge. My research was focused on designing safety fallback mechanisms for autonomous systems with provable guarantees. I utilize various tools, ranging from classical control to model-based safety filters, to enable these filters to satisfy desirable properties such as smooth handover and robustness to imperfect models. My general research focus over the past few years has been on applying optimization and learning methods to control applications.

## Outside Work

Back in my undergraduate days, I was crazy about tennis and represented the institute at the inter-IIT sports meet and the inter-collegiate sports fest. I was also part of the gold medal winning team of Tapti hostel in Schroeter 2012.

I was also into app development in my undergraduate days. I helped build android apps for the institute technical and cultural festivals, Shaastra and Saarang.
