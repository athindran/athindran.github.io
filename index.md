Hi. I am Athindran. I am currently a software engineer at Aurora innovation in Pittsburgh, PA. I was a sixth year PhD student in the department of Electrical Engineering at Princeton University. I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. Peter Ramadge. My current research is focused on designing safety fallback mechanisms for autonomous systems with provable guarantees. I use various tools from classical control to enable these model-based safety filters to satisfy desirable properties such as smooth handover and robustness to imperfect physics-based models.

## Outside Work

Back in my undergraduate days, I was crazy about tennis and represented the institute at the inter-IIT sports meet and the inter-collegiate sports fest. I was also part of the gold medal winning team of Tapti hostel in Schroeter 2012.

I was also into app development in my undergraduate days. I helped build android apps for the institute technical and cultural festivals, Shaastra and Saarang.
